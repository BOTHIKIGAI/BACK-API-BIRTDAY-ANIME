# Logging
---

This document describes the configuration established for log recovery of the application.

## Document Contents

This document includes:
- **Purpose of logs:** Description of why logs were implemented.
- **Configuration:** Explanation of the configuration and format.

### Purpose of logs
Logs are used in software to record and track events that occur within an application, providing valuable information
for debugging issues, monitoring system performance, identifying security threats, and understanding user behavior,
essentially acting as a historical record to help developers troubleshoot problems and optimize the software's
functionality effectively.

### Configuration
The log configuration is located in the `logging.py` file in the config directory.

- ***Version and control of existing loggers***
    - Indicates the version of the configuration scheme. Currently, the only supported value is 1.
    - disable_existing_loggers: False
    - This prevents loggers already created in the application from being disabled, allowing existing
      loggers to continue working after applying this configuration.

- ***Formatters***
    A formatter called detailed is defined here that specifies the output format of each message.
    -   The format '%(asctime)s [%(processName)s:%(process)d] [%(threadName)s:%(thread)d] [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s' includes:
        - asctime: timestamp.
        - processName and process: Name and ID of the process.
        - threadName and thread: Name and ID of the thread.
        - levelname: Log level (DEBUG, INFO, etc.).
        - name: Logger name.
        - message: The message to log.

- ***Handlers***
    Two handlers are defined, which are responsible for sending messages to different destinations:
    - console:
      - Uses the logging.StreamHandler class to send the messages to the standard output (sys.stdout).
      - It uses the detailed formatter.
    - file:
      - Uses the logging.FileHandler class to write the logs to a file.
      - The file is defined with os.path.join(LOG_DIR, 'app.log'), that is, it is created in the directory
        indicated by the LOG_DIR variable.
      - It also uses the detailed.

- ***Loggers***
  Specific loggers are configured here for different parts of the application:

    - uvicorn.error:
      - Configured to capture and manage error messages generated by Uvicorn.
      - It uses both file and console handlers.
      - Its level is set to DEBUG, which means that messages of this level or higher will be logged.
      - With propagate: False, messages are prevented from being passed on to higher level loggers (which avoids duplication).

    - BIRTHDAY_ANIME:
      - Defined for the logger of a specific part of the application (possibly a module or component called “BIRTHDAY_ANIME”).
      - It uses only the file handler, so its messages will be written only to the file.
      - It also has the DEBUG and propagate: False level to prevent your messages from being propagated.
